New News - The RSS Feed News Aggregator 

New News is a webpage designed to aggregate RSS News feeds input by the user into a single scrolling window, sorted from latest to oldest. Its purpose is to provide a personalized source of news for the reader, reducing the need to sift through meaningless or off-topic headlines. One should be able to sit down with their morning coffee and have the latest economics, finance, medical, pop culture or strictly local news at their hands without the need to wade through different sites and attention stealing side-stories. New News allows you to put together any combinaton of specific news subcategories together into one place for easy access. This goal is achieved using html/CSS, JavaScript, and the Bulma CSS framework, while also incorporating RSS code provided by news sources of choice. 


How it works:
    Provided on the New News site is a starter list of RSS feeds that anyone can pull from and input into the input bar that is front and center in the home page. There are step by step directions on how to find an RSS feed on any news site, from Axios to the Wall St. Journal, on the front page of New News, directly below the RSS input bar. This documentation explains what an RSS feed stands for, where to find it on a website and how to copy and input the feed into the New News aggregator. The New News tool will:
        
        1. Save input RSS fields such that they will appear each time the user visits the site using the user's local storage
        2. Update each individual RSS feed as articles are added to it by the originial news publication and show the new article to the user
        3. List news articles in order from newest to oldest in a scrollable format
        4. Show each news article as a clickable headline that allows the reader to follow that link to the original news site
